Harness Phase 1: this file becomes the repo's decision log; working agreements in ~/HARNESS.md apply.

## 2026-08-21 — Consolidated open dependency-update PRs into a single branch
11 open Renovate/Dependabot PRs (#339, #338, #337, #336, #334, #333, #332,
#301, #282, #280, #276) were consolidated into one branch
`deps/consolidated-2026-08` -> PR #342, rather than merging/cherry-picking
each branch and hand-resolving yarn.lock conflicts. Approach: extract each
PR's version-bump intent, apply the union directly to `package.json` once,
then regenerate `yarn.lock` with a single `yarn install` — this collapses
duplicate/superseded bumps automatically since yarn.lock is a generated
artifact, not something to diff/merge by hand.

- eslint (#339), ip-address (#333), nuxt-schema-org (#282) needed no
  package.json edit — their target versions were already satisfied by
  existing semver ranges or were transitive/lockfile-only; folded into the
  same `yarn install` regeneration.
- The `packageManager` (yarn) bump (#276) was isolated into its own commit
  so it can be reverted independently of the dependency bumps if it
  misbehaves.
- Verified directly (not delegated blindly): `yarn install`, `yarn lint`,
  `yarn build`, `yarn npm audit --severity moderate` all passed clean in the
  worktree before opening the PR; the two security advisories
  (brace-expansion, fast-uri) are cleared per audit output.
- Routed the mechanical edit/regenerate work to Codex CLI per the AI tool
  router (Tier 2, well-scoped dependency work); Hermes did the planning,
  dispatch, and independent verification.
- Once #342 merges, close the 11 originals as superseded.
